            <p>Hello, my name is Uzoma Offor! I am a 2nd year at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I am currently studying Computational Media which is a mixture of computer science and design. I am also a first generation Nigerian American.In my free time, I enjoy listening to and writing music and also playing my guitar. I also watch an excessive amount of television and youtube too. If you are looking for a good time, watch competitive eating videos on youtube. Speaking of eating, I love all types of food and my favorite part of traveling is getting to try new dishes. I have been to a couple countries and many states and I hope to expand that in the future.</p>
